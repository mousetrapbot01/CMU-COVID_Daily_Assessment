# CMU-Self-Assessment

This script is for the lazy CMU students who wish to participate in the COVID daily-assessment
Use this for your own good! I do not endorse fraudulant or malicious actions regarding
self-reporting of COVID.

I am by no means a python master. Feel free to give me feedback on my project. Happy scripting!

## Variables
The variables represent each of the items in the assessment.
The default values are (False, False, 0)

1. close_contact = True - Have had contact, False - No close contact
2. any_symptoms  = True - I have symptoms,  False - I don't
3. temp_higher   = 1 - Yes,    0 - No,    -1 - I didn't check

## Requirements
1. python version: python 3.x.x          (anything will do, mine: 3.7.7)
2. packages:       webbrowser, pyautogui (can be installed from pip - pip install _)
3. You need to be signed in with your andrew email in your default browser (can open canvas without having to log in)

## How-To-Use
Change the variables above in some text editor. (e.g. vim)
Run the script after changing the variables. Leave the screen as python does its job.

## Updates
10/7/20: I have not tested this other than my own computer, which is running windows 10 - chrome as its default browser
